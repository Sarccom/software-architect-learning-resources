# Software Architect Learning Resources

There is no shortcut to becoming a Software Architect.

There is a lot of things to learn, because learning is a never-ending process.
When you stop learning, somehow in some situation you will feel obsolete.

Being a Software Architect is not always about technology, you need to aware of business and politics. And has a great way to communicate with each stakeholder including your teammates. The key is communication, collaboration and negotiation.

And you need to have a hands-on skill to proof your understanding and to share your knowledge.

Not to try to simplify things, but this can be your anchor about Software Architect role. A software architect role typically has 50% tech things and 50% non-tech things. Assume that number is subjective, so it depends on your situation in your organization.

Actually being a Software Architect is the path to becoming VP Engineering or Chief Technology Officer or similar roles or even better you can be a Technopreneur to start your own startup company by yourself :sunglasses:

## Methodologies

Why we need a methodology? Even when working alone.

Methodology is the systematic, theoretical analysis of the methods applied to a field of study. It comprises the theoretical analysis of the body of methods and principles associated with a branch of knowledge. Typically, it encompasses concepts such as paradigm, theoretical model, phases and quantitative or qualitative techniques. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology))

As a Software Architect knowing several methodologies is a plus. To adapt and create a strategy to deliver excellence. But at least need to know deeply about one methodology.

### Certified Software Architect by Carnegie Mellon University

Software architecture is the primary carrier of system qualities, such as performance, modifiability, and security. Architecture helps ensure that a design approach will yield an acceptable system and holds the key to maintenance and sustainment efforts. In short, architecture is the glue that holds every phase of a project together. To realize these benefits, you need to build the capability to architect effectively. The SEI offers the Software Architecture Professional Certificate to equip software professionals with state-of-the-art practices for designing, analyzing, documenting, and implementing software architectures.

## Role Model

A role model is a person whose behavior, example, or success is or can be emulated by others, especially by younger people. The term role model is credited to sociologist Robert K. Merton, who coined the phrase during his career. Merton hypothesized that individuals compare themselves with reference groups of people who occupy the social role to which the individual aspires. An example being the way young fans will idolize and imitate professional athletes or entertainment artists. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model))
