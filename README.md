# Software Architect Learning Resources

There is no shortcut to becoming a Software Architect.

There is a lot of things to learn, because learning is a never-ending process.
When you stop learning, somehow in some situation you will feel obsolete.

Being a Software Architect is not always about technology, you need to aware of business and politics. And has a great way to communicate with each stakeholder including your teammates. The key is communication, collaboration and negotiation.

And you need to have a hands-on skill to proof your understanding and to share your knowledge.

Not to try to simplify things, but this can be your anchor about Software Architect role. A software architect role typically has 50% tech things and 50% non-tech things. Assume that number is subjective, so it depends on your situation in your organization.

Actually being a Software Architect is the path to becoming VP Engineering or Chief Technology Officer or similar roles or even better you can be a Technopreneur, start your own startup company by yourself :sunglasses:

## Methodologies

Why we need a methodology? Even when working alone.

Methodology is the systematic, theoretical analysis of the methods applied to a field of study. It comprises the theoretical analysis of the body of methods and principles associated with a branch of knowledge. Typically, it encompasses concepts such as paradigm, theoretical model, phases and quantitative or qualitative techniques. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology))

As a Software Architect knowing several methodologies is a plus. To adapt and create a strategy to deliver excellence. But at least need to know deeply about one methodology.
